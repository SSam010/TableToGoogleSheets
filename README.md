# TableToGoogleSheets
Parsing a table from a website to Google Sheets

This script allows you to parse a table from a website and transfer it to your Google Sheets.
First you need to set up a Google service account and get its key in JSON format.
The libraries required for operation are specified in the requirements.txt file.
The work of the script is very simple:
1) run table_to_google.py file
2) specify the address of the location of the service account key
3) specify the email address with which you want to share the created table.
